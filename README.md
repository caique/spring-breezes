# Spring Breezes

Hey you! Welcome to the **Spring Breezes** series!

If you are interested in some thoughts about Spring Framework this is the right place for you!

In this collection of posts I will try my best to put in words all my knowledge and experience regarding topics such as tools, architectural decisions, best practices, and everything else that comes to mind and lives at Spring's land.

## Disclaimers
First things first! Read the following bullet points to ensure that our expectations are aligned.

- "Spring" can be many things! I'll use the term "_Spring_" to refer to many things such as tools, components, the Spring Project itself, "_Spring Boot_", "_Spring MVC_", etc. I'll do my best to avoid any ambiguity and probably will use the post context to do so.
- For many reasons I won't go deep on the explanation of some topics. I'll assume that you already know some terms and will put a lot of links along the texts to serve as references for the topics I consider important but are not the focus of a given post. If you consider that an information is too superficial, please let me know and I'll do my best to improve the content.
- If you code at a professional level, probably your business context is extremely more complex than the scope of these posts. Therefore, it's your responsibility to understand the ideas and adjust accordingly with your constraints and requirements.
- Code samples can be simple! They are mostly used to support opinions and sometimes won't get closer to the complexity of a real project. Feel free to contact me if you want to go deeper into any topic. I'd love to offer a more robust example to explain my ideas.
- As always, [there is no silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)! This posts aims to communicate ideas that surely can be improved in many ways. Feel free to contact me with suggestions.

Last but not least, **feedbacks are more than welcome**! Let me know if you think something can be improved. Your feedback will make easier for other people to understand.
